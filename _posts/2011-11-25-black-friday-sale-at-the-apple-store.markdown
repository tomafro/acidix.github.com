[Apple][astore] has started its annual [Black Friday Sale][astore]! The major models (iMac, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air) have the most discounts, however, not the kind of discount you'd wait a whole year for. 

I finally ordered myself a [Magic Trackpad][trackpad] to make use of all the new multi-touch gestures in OS Lion on my iMac. 

The sale is on in (as far as I know) all countries, so not limited to the U.S. and/or UK. So make use of it as long as it lasts!
